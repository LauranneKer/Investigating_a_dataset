    "The purpose of this analysis is to understand:\n",
    "- What are the factors that give a stronger chance to a country to count more family female workers? \n",
    "- How did the female/male family workers ratio evolve over time in 2 selected european countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this perspective, we will analyse _economy, education, equality and society_ indicators to estimate their effect on the rate of female family workers. We are going to select 10 countries around the world to frame this analysis."
